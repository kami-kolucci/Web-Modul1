        <span>Shattering cookware</span><br />More than 37,000 people were
        injured from using cookware. Hot handles can burn and sometimes glass
        cookware can shatter.

        <span>Microwave oven burns</span><br />More than 10,000 people were hurt
        using microwaves. Burns were most common.

        <span>Knife cuts</span><br />Lacerations caused by knives of all kinds
        (not just the kitchen type) affected more than 350,000 people in 2012,
        according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Dull knives are
        actually more dangerous than sharp ones, because they require more
        pressure to use and their worn edge can cause the knife to slip off food
        and into your fingers.

        <span>Cooking fires</span><br />Fires involving cooking equipment
        account for two of every five reported home fires. Unattended cooking
        equipment accounts for one in three fires, and half are ignited by fat,
        grease, oil, or related substances, according to the National Fire
        Protection Association.

        <span>Contact Burns From Equipment</span><br />The oven is magic. No
        longer do we have to sear our food on an open fire like our ancestors
        did; we have a nifty box that keeps the heat contained and cooks our
        food to perfection. But all that heat combined with metal components and
        cookware leads to loads of burns. Quick tips (which are obvious, but
        good to keep in mind): Always use oven mitts, replace them when they’re
        old; don’t use a wet towel as an oven mitt; don’t reach your arm in to
        check baked goods, pull out the rack to test;

        <span>Death to the Pathogens</span><br />The most insidious of all
        dangers, perhaps, are the germs lurking in your food. The Centers for
        Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that each year roughly
        one in six Americans (or 48 million people) gets sick, 128,000 are
        hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases. The top five culprits
        sending Americans to the hospital are salmonella, norovirus,
        Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii and E.coli – but much can be done
        in terms of proper food handling, cooking and storage to help prevent
        these pathogens from causing illness.
