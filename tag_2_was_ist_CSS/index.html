    <p>He taught me a code. To survive. Keep your mind limber. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.</p>

    <p>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Saving the world with meals on wheels. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>

    <p>Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidatesâ€¦ PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
    <p>Oh Leela! <strong> You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. </strong> <em> In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up!</em> Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>

    <p>And I'm his friend Jesus. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Belligerent and numerous. Also Zoidberg. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
    <p>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Large bet on myself in round one. Yep, I remember.</p> -->
